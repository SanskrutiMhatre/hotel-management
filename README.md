# HOTEL-MANGEMENT-SYSTEM

This Python-based hotel management system is designed to manage customer check-ins, checkouts, and provide information about customers staying at the hotel. The system enables hotel staff to efficiently handle guest data and streamline the check-in/check-out process.

Features
Check-in: Add new customers to the hotel database upon check-in. Gather necessary details such as name, room number, check-in date, etc.
Checkout: Remove customers from the database upon checkout. Update room availability and generate bills if needed.
Customer Information: Retrieve and display information about customers staying at the hotel, including their check-in date, room number, and duration of stay.
